# MobileFormApp

## Prerequisites

* [daybed](http://daybed.rtfd.org/) backend to store answers sent from your app

* The latest version of [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) to build your app

## Setup

1. ```npm install```

2. ```gulp install [--os android|ios|all]```
The gulp install parameter allow to configure the ionic project environment for build your app in future. If no parameters are specified, the project environment will be configured to work with Android.
3. As the config file is not yet generated by Gulp, you must edit `www/config.json` to specify your backend url.

**Warning:** Your daybed model must match with your [angular-schema-form](https://github.com/Textalk/angular-schema-form) config (stored in `www/mock_schema.json` and `www/mock_form.json`)

## Start

The application starts as an ionic Application :

* ```ionic serve``` to view it in your browser

* ```Ã¬onic run``` to build, install and launch it on your smartphone
